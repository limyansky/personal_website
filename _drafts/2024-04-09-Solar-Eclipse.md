"We see the same moon, you and Iâ€”you in your world and I in mine. I find that comforting."

Its a nice, unattributable sentiment that has been the focus of [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Same_Moon), [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx-UzMiNK5A), and [facebook posts](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&q=under+the+same+moon+quote&iax=images&ia=images) the world over.
So... what harm will one more blog post do? 
On April 8, 2024, when a solar eclipse swept through the United States, I had friends who chased it throughout the country, from Texas to New York.

Some more introduction

## My Eclipse Viewing
Of the four perspectives presented in this article, my personal eclipse viewing is the only one from outside the path of totality.
Dropping a pin at my location:

we can see that I only saw about 83% coverage from my viewing location outside of Atlanta, GA.
According to [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/safety/), the only time it is safe to view the eclipse without some kind of protection is during complete totality.
My solution to this dilemma was a unique mix of basic and fancy: an old [Calumet CC-400](http://camera-wiki.org/wiki/Calumet_CC-400) view camera with a pinhole "lens" consisting of some aluminum foil punctured by a mechanical pencil (Note: This isn't a tutorial or endorsement of this method! If you're interested, instead follow instructions for constructing an "eclipse projector" from NASA or other reputable source.)

The camera itself (the accordion-like object in the above image) is essentially just empty space - a place to hold the lens on the front, a place to hold film on the back, and a light-tight tube connecting the two.
When the film is removed, the lens instead projects an image on a piece of ground glass, allowing you to compose a photo (as long as you're in a dark enough space, which is why old photographers are often seen huddling under a cloth hood).
The resultant image on the ground glass is upside-down, something handheld cameras correct with a pentaprism, and backwards, due to viewing the image "from behind" as it is projected on the ground glass. 
See the image below, taken by [Cameron Shaw](https://www.flickr.com/photos/camshaw/51280977749/in/pool-camerawiki/), as an example of these effects:

The result wasn't the prettiest thing in the world, but it worked! At 3:10 pm, I snapped the photo of the eclipse shown to the right below. 
Unsurprisingly, it matches perfectly with Mathematica's visualization for my time and location (shown on the left)! 
It is easy to see the mirroring I mentioned earlier, and if you look closely enough, you can make out the inversion as well.

## My Friends' Eclipses

As I mentioned earlier, I had friends travel to Dallas, Texas; Rochester, New York; and Mt. Nebo, Arkansas to view the eclipse in totality.
I've added pins for all four locations to the map below:

Rochester was cloudy, but its still cool to look at all four locations simultaneously to "watch" the eclipse transit the US!
