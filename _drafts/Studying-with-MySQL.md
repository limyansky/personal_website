<!-- 
SQL puts the "Data" in "Data Science".
Can you do science without data?
Sure, but we call those people "Theorists", and if you're reading this you're either not interested in, or fleeing from, such a destitute lifestyle. -->

SQL is a programming language used to access information stored on a special type of database called a _relational_ database.
In a nutshell, relational databases offer an easy way to tie together clusters of information.
For example, a school database may consist of three tables: "Student Information", "Skydiving Club", and "Flying Club".
SQL provides an easy way to, say, find students in "Skydiving Club" with over 100 jumps, cross reference that with students having over 100 flight hours in "Flying Club", and look up their emails in "Student Information" so that they can be congratulated.
Data science makes heavy use of relational databases, and thus SQL.

Using SQL to query a database isn't a particularly arduous task, but it does involve a specific syntax that is best studied through repetition.
As such, I thought it best to set up a database early in my studies.
By using this to store my practice data, I'll be getting SQL experience as I follow along with other portions of my study material.

## Installation
SQL comes in many different [dialects](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-find-your-way-through-the-different-types-of-sql-26e3d3c20aab), which are slight variations of the language.
I have selected MySQL, as it seems reasonably popular, has a nice GUI that I find helpful for learning, and is one of the dialects available on [HackerRank](hackerrank.com) (a website often used to test programming skills in job interviews).
