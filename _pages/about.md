I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz, where I received my PhD in physics for my work studying the emission mechanism of pulsars. I have made this website primarily to showcase personal projects relevant to a career in data science, but will also be showcasing some of my more technically oriented hobbies. For more information on my career, including academic works, please visit my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/limyansky/). On the hobby side, I occasionally post photographs I've taken on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/193944838@N06/).
